      title: 'One Summers Day',
      text: 'Chihiro Ogino, a disaffected child, is annoyed about having to move to a new town. She is traveling with her parents in their 1996 Audi A4 Quattro to their new home. While driving to their new house, Chihiros father attempts to follow a shortcut; they subsequently lose their way and come across a mysterious red gate and a tunnel which exits to a clock tower and leads to what appears to be an abandoned theme park, lined with seemingly empty restaurants.'

      title: 'Nightfall',
      text: 'Chihiros distress at losing her parents is compounded by the discoveries that the world around her has changed and that her body seems to be disappearing. A mysterious boy named Haku appears, comforts Chihiro, and gives her a red berry to eat, which makes her solid again. He smuggles her into a large bathhouse owned and operated by the witch Yubaba, where thousands of spirits come to refresh themselves. Haku tells Chihiro that the only way she can remain in the spirit-world long enough to rescue her parents is by gaining employment in Yubabas bathhouse. When Chihiro asks Haku how he seems to know her so well, Haku replies that he has known Chihiro since she was very small.'

      title: 'The Contract',
      text: 'At first, she tries to get work with Kamajī, who works at the boiler room, but is rejected. Kamajī instead hands Chihiro off to the worker, Lin, to take her to Yubaba. In Yubabas penthouse suite, Chihiro repeatedly asks for a job, overriding the monstrous witchs refusals. Yubaba ultimately consents, on condition that Chihiro give up her name.'

      title: 'Life at the Bathhouse',
      text: 'Subsequently, Sen sees Haku in the form of a white dragon, and later on helps save him from attacking Shikigami. Searching for the injured Haku, Sen encounters Yubabas big infant son, Boh at her apartment. Sen finds Haku, who was attacked by Zeniba, Yubabas twin sister, because Haku had stolen her sigil. When Boh distracts Zeniba, she transforms Boh into a mouse, and Yu-Bird into a hummingbird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic gold seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku then rips up the remaining Shikigami, causing Zeniba to disappear.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Sens Courage',
      text: 'In the bathhouse, Yubaba discovers Bohs absence and is enraged. Haku, now revived and restored to his human form, offers Bohs safe return in exchange for Sen and her parents to be freed and restored to normal. Yubaba accepts, but promises to set Sen one final task. Along with Boh and Yu-Bird, Haku and Sen fly back to the bathhouse, leaving No-Face to live with Zeniba as her assistant. En route to the bathhouse, Chihiro remembers a previously suggested meeting with Haku: some time ago, she had fallen into a river and was rescued by the rivers spirit.'

    {
      title: 'The Return',
      text: 'Yubaba and a large crowd have gathered to witness Chihiros final task: to pick out her cursed parents from a group of pigs. Chihiro correctly states that none of the pigs displayed by Yubaba are her parents, and thus wins back both her parents humanity and her own freedom from the bathhouse. Afterward, Haku takes Chihiro to rejoin her restored parents. He bids her farewell and promises that he will come see her again. As Chihiro and her parents return to their world, her parents lose all memory of their visit to the spirit world. The family then gets back in their car and resume their journey to their new home.'
